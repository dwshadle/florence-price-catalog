# Florence Price Thematic Catalog

## Introduction

This open-access catalog is a companion project to <a href="https://blair.vanderbilt.edu/bio/douglas-shadle" target="_blank">Douglas Shadle</a>'s biography of Florence B. Price in the Oxford University Press Master Musicians series. Shadle (Associate Professor of Musicology, Vanderbilt University), the principal catalog compiler, generates or revises the entries as new data is gathered and processed.

Student contributors transcribe and review new thematic incipits under Shadle's supervision. This process not only enables Price's music to be more visible and discoverable, but enables students to develop expertise in digital transcription, editing, and coding methods.

## Features
Each catalog entry contains the following data (where known):
- Title
- Composition year
- Copyright Information
- Instrumentation
- Length
- Lyric author and source
- Manuscript sources
- Premiere performance
- Published editions
- Recordings
- Thematic incipits
- Bibliography

A distinctive feature of the project is a built-in thematic catalog with incipits programmed using the machine-readable structures of the <a href="https://music-encoding.org/" target="_blank">Music Encoding Initiative</a> (MEI).

## History of the Project

The project launched in January 2023 with several entries for well-known works, such as the symphonies and concertos. An <a href="https://rebalancing-music-canon.com/price/" target="_blank">initial batch of thematic incipits</a> came from the <a href="https://rebalancing-music-canon.com/" target="_blank">Rebalancing the Music Canon</a> project created by <a href="http://annakijas.com/" target="_blank">Anna Kijas</a> (Head, Lilly Music Library, Tufts University). All metadata entries for the files borrowed from that project have been preserved according to the licensing terms, while the original files may be found in the project <a href="https://github.com/annakijas1/rebalancing-music-canon" target="_blank">GitHub Repository</a>.
