This open-access catalog aims to present high-quality information about the musical works written by composer Florence B. Price. A digital catalog that can keep pace with the evolving landscape of Price performance and scholarship is essential to serve growing global interest in Price and her music.

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>[View the Table of Contents](https://dwshadle.github.io/florence-price-catalog/_pages/complete-works/)</b></p>

Each catalog entry contains the following data (where known):
- Title
- Composition year
- Instrumentation
- Length
- Lyric author and source
- Manuscript sources
- Premiere performance
- Published editions
- Recordings
- Thematic incipits
- Bibliography

A distinctive feature of the project is a built-in thematic catalog with incipits programmed using the machine-readable structures of the <a href="https://music-encoding.org/" target="_blank">Music Encoding Initiative</a> (MEI). This data-driven approach enables the project to complement other ongoing digital initiatives that foreground composers from historically marginalized groups, including:
- <a href="https://rebalancing-music-canon.com/" target="_blank">Rebalancing the Music Canon</a> created by Anna Kijas
- <a href="https://www.musicbywomen.org/" target="_blank">Music by Women</a> created by Molly Murdock and Ben Parsell
