This open-access catalog aims to present high-quality information about the musical works written by composer Florence B. Price. Since interest in Price's oeuvre has grown rapidly since 2018, a digital catalog that can keep pace with the evolving landscape of Price performance and scholarship is essential. Each catalog entry contains the following data (where known):
- Title
- Composition year
- Instrumentation
- Length
- Manuscript sources
- Premiere performance
- Published editions
- Recordings
- Thematic incipits
- Bibliography

A distinctive feature of the project is a built-in thematic catalog with incipits programmed using the machine-readable structures of the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI). This data-driven approach enables the project to complement other ongoing initiatives that foreground composers from historically marginalized groups.
