## Notes
[^fn1]: Certain recent sources list Burke's dates of life as 1836&ndash;1928, suggesting that he was Capt. James Burke, described in the *Staten Island Advance* (April 24, 1924) as a "prolific writer of verse." Burke's [gravestone](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/88433800/james-burke) gives his birth year as 1835. Obituaries listed him variously as 91, 92, and 93 years old when he died in April 1928.
[^fn2]: This score contains the dedication, "Dedicated to Marian Anderson" in blue pen.
