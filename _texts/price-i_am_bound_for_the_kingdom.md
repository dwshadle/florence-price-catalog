## Notes
[^fn1]: At the top of this manuscript, the facsimile notes that this piece is part of a collection called "Two Traditional Negro Spirituals as sung by the slave grandmother of Mrs. Fannie Carter Woods, Chicago." The word also "Anderson" (for Marian Anderson) appears at the top in pencil.
[^fn2]: This manuscript is in a bound collection with "I'm Workin' On My Buildin'." The phase "C Major" appears in pencil and red colored pencil, perhaps indicating a transposition for Marian Anderson from the original key of G major.
